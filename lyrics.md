# Slundge (The Collective)

## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (heavy)

Continuum
No trace where it started from
All in one
Seeks to be discrete though
We're all caught in the flow
Dread to be a domestique

Fall down the cascade
Hierarchically afraid
Streamlined
Though blind
Try to control
One's role
Can't be heaven with perfect souls
Spokes pull different ways with the same goal


### Prechorus 1

Sighs low
Whispering inside a tornado
[There's not really any point]


### Chorus 1

Blown to pieces by the wind
Dissipated all within
I'm waiting for rain
To escape
Entrain me


### Post-chorus 1 (jazzy)

Scatting?


### Verse 2 (jazzy)

Continuum
Didn't even talk to 'em
Now just walking randomly
Past
On a free path
Feel bad for acting kind of mean

Bop bop up down bout the background slow
Perturbations grow
Disparate rarefied
But yeah we got to move together
To glean clues
From obscene news

To infinitely shear
We can't all steer
Row row... row


### Prechorus 2

Cries slowed
Whispering the things I wanna know

What a relief
It doesn't really matter if anyone thinks it matters


### Chorus 2

Blown to pieces by the wind
Dissipated all within
I'm fucking on TV (walking on DC?)
Fucking those who fucked with me

Should be lifting like a wing
Not dragging (stalling?) hating everything
I'm waiting for rain
To escape
Entrain me


### Slop post-chorus

OWWWWW
OOO
HEEEEEAVE
HOOOOOOOOOO


### Solo break

[Some kinds of whispers or ambient stuff? Polymeter timing for vox]
[Mimic guitar melody with BG vox?]
Panta Rhei


### Nu metal part

[Background vox]
This is the only show
Whisper the sum up past zero


### Final prechorus (whispered)

Steps shown
Whispering the way it's gonna go
Winds blown
Slips beneath the ways I feel alone

I see
Hating all the things I have to be
Natural path replaces I with we


## Other ideas

Why's it felt so commonly
Self outside society

Some seem to be pulling against
But that pulls back to the right direction

Every thought and action
Eventually evaporates
Anxiety from individuality
A false dichotomy
We can as one be

Put yourself where you'll do the most damage
Be honest about what that is

It's one of nature's quirks
Ratio of a million failures to one that works

Join the chambers together
Echoing like a wave
Breaking toxic instincts

Flip the tendency to take
Energy should move between scales

Checks and balances
Being liked isn't always possible
Or desirable

A disliked contrarian
A perturbation
Could cause chaotic change
Could be damped

Even a cog is a purpose
All spokes pull a different way
A link in the chain

Polar and nonpolar
In the same container
Don't mix
Different density
Instability

Miserable to try to be
That one particle in the sea

We're all the sun
Single family
But not like that

No villains or heroes
A revelation when you're not the sun

Success for one is success for all
Your beauty is our beauty
It's not zero sum
It's cumulative

Pressure can't become diffusion
Accept your term

Everything expects nothing
Sudden bifurcation in thought
All the tension between us

If you remove the bad parts of yourself
You become less of yourself
In heaven we can't exist

Only the collective has a chance at knowing it all
Only shameful to be a layman if you act like an expert
We've got our archetypes
We can't escape

There will always be a best and an average
But we can all rule
Greatness has more dimensions than we perceive
All tired of trying to be admired
Algorithms make it feel worse

Melted in obscurity
One raindrop in the storm
The one that breaks the dam
Wouldn't happen without the others

Peddled influence
Subdominant
Momentum balance

Kiss the world goodbye it's time to go

Unique rhymes with domestique

Lay low
Feel the pressure say which way to go

Single family
Won't be if that's how we make our homes

Churning
Ablating

A seed is a perturbation in the biosphere
Could be damped
Could change the course of history
But that's not up to the seed
It's up to the whole system
