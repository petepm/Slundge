# Slundge (The Collective)

## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (heavy)

Continuum
No trace where it started from
All in one
Wants to be discrete though
We're all caught in the flow
Dread to be a domestique

Fall down the cascade
Hierarchically afraid
Streamline
Lone mind
Try to control
One's role
Can't be heaven with perfect souls
Spokes pull different ways with the same goal


### Prechorus 1

Die slow
Whispering inside a tornado
[There's not really any point]


### Chorus 1

Blown to pieces by the wind
Dissipated all within
I'm waiting for rain
To escape
Entrain me


### Post-chorus 1 (jazzy)

Scatting?


### Verse 2 (jazzy)

Continuum
Didn't even talk to 'em
Oscillate randomly
The patterns could they be math
Not a free path
Feel bad for acting kind of mean

Up down left right over the background show
Perturbations grow
Disparate rarefied
But yeah we got to move together
To glean clues
From obscene news

To infinitely shear
We can't all steer
Row row... row


### Prechorus 2

Cries stowed
Whispering the things I wanna know

What a relief
It doesn't really matter if anyone thinks it matters


### Chorus 2

Blown to pieces by the wind
Dissipated all within
I'm fucking on TV (walking on DC?)
Fucking those who fucked with me

Should be lifting like a wing
Not dragging hating everything
I'm waiting for rain
To escape
Entrain me


### Slop post-chorus

OWWWWW
OOO
HEEEEEAVE
HOOOOOOOOOO


### Solo break

[Some kinds of whispers or ambient stuff? Polymeter timing for vox]
[Mimic guitar melody with BG vox?]
Panta Rhei


### Nu metal part

Sum villains and heroes
Balance momentum so below


### Final prechorus (whispered)

Tides grow
Whispering to those above chapeau

Lay low
Feel the pressure say which way to go
