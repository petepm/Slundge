# Lyrics: The Cyclic and the Collective

I was stalling like a wing
Just stuck hating everything

The cyclic and the collective are in play
Pitching faster than I can say

There's no best particle
But we're not particles
Panta Rhei

If I don't fit its because I tried not to.

I've put myself on a pedestal for no reason.
Time to stop being an idiot and accept being an idiot.

Negativity is not gonna get me nowhere.

People are who they are. People are different, and that's fine. Everything flows.
Some are pressure
Some are diffusion
No need for envy

I can accept the reality that we are all necessary, and it allows me to not have to be like you to accept you.

Will probably go my whole life without participating
Just spectating
I think I'm okay with that for now

Can't blame anyone else for my being a shrinking soliton

Everything expects nothing

Sudden bifurcation in thought realizing that all the tension between us is good for the system as a whole

If you remove the bad parts of yourself you become less of yourself
In heaven we can't exist

How can I reconcile hating humans and loving humanity?

Collectively we can know everything, but alone that is impossible.
This is an illusion I have been operating under
Learn to trust others to think about things more deeply and know more than I

Life becomes so absurd in these hours

People only dwell on their own failures

its only shameful to be a layman if you act like an expert.

Specialization is the way
Knowing everything and being perfect is unreasonable.

We've got our archetypes
We can't escape

Unlikable people exist
So what

In the end most of us
We are just beggars

There will always be a best and an average
But we can all rule

There are castes
It's set in iron
It will always last

Not special
Not going to be special
But don't have to be
That's not what it's all about

Don't have to be the best to be objectively great

Social media algorithms make it worse
Isolated like a curse
Further separated from society
Why does this not induce anxiety
Role could be for something else

A domestique of life

Used to feel the need to be mired
Now I want to be alone with my toys
That stuff made me so tired
Something about specialization


##Chorus

Something something never ends
Something something my revenge

Accepted who I'm gonna be
Melting in obscurity

Needed to be a snowflake
But now accepting the lift of a raindrop

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Now it's not what you do, it's who you are

Be stoic
Can't be heroic


## Lyrical themes

Ranting is projection

Start off feeling like it's unfair to be this way
And how everyone should be like me
Then realize we all flow together
We're all different terms that balance

The individualistic goals are ruining our society. We pay execs more but
workers less. Everyone wants to be the one in charge, but every link in the
chain is important.

Flip side of coin to Eigengarbage -- subdominant people are of importance to
society, just like all are. Is there a musical pun in there? Dominant
subdominant, ehehehehe.  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)>

All my pain really stems from not realizing that not everyone thinks exactly
the same, but that's okay. It helped us.
