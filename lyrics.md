# Slundge (The Collective)

## Lyrics

### Verse 1 (heavy)

Continuum
No trace where it started from
All in one
Wants to be discrete though
We're all caught in the flow
Dread to be a domestique

Fall down the cascade
Hierarchically afraid
Streamline
Lone mind
Try to control
One's role
Can't be heaven with perfect souls
Spokes pull different ways with the same goal


### Prechorus 1

Die slow
Whispering inside a tornado
[There's not really any point]


### Chorus 1

Blown to pieces by the wind
Dissipated all within
I'm waiting for rain
To escape
Entrain me


### Post-chorus 1 (jazzy)

Scatting?


### Verse 2 (jazzy)

Continuum
Didn't even talk to 'em
Oscillate randomly
The patterns could they be math
Not a free path
Feel bad for acting kind of mean

Up down left right over the background show
Perturbations grow
Disparate rarefied
But yeah we got to move together
To glean clues
From obscene news

To infinitely shear
We can't all steer
Row row... row


### Prechorus 2

Cries stowed
Whispering the things I wanna know

What a relief
It doesn't really matter if anyone thinks it matters


### Chorus 2

Blown to pieces by the wind
Dissipated all within
I'm fucking on TV (walking on DC?)
Fucking those who fucked with me

Should be lifting like a wing
Not dragging hating everything
I'm waiting for rain
To escape
Entrain me


### Slop post-chorus

OWWWWW
OOO
HEEEEEAVE
HOOOOOOOOOO


### Solo break

[Some kinds of whispers or ambient stuff? Polymeter timing for vox]
[Mimic guitar melody with BG vox?]
Panta Rhei


### Nu metal part

Sum villains and heroes
Balance momentum so below


### Final prechorus (whispered)

Tides grow
Whispering to those above chapeau

Lay low
Feel the pressure say which way to go


## Other ideas

Every thought and action
Eventually evaporates
Anxiety from individuality
A false dichotomy
We can as one be

It's one of nature's quirks
Ratio of a million failures to one that works

Join the chambers together
Echoing like a wave
Breaking toxic instincts

Flip the tendency to take
Energy should move between scales

Even a cog is a purpose
A link in the chain

Polar and nonpolar
In the same container
Don't mix
Different density
Instability

Miserable to try to be
That one particle in the sea

Success for one is success for all
Your beauty is our beauty
It's not zero sum
It's cumulative

Everything expects nothing
Sudden bifurcation in thought
All the tension between us

If you remove the bad parts of yourself
You become less of yourself
In heaven we can't exist

Only the collective has a chance at knowing it all
Only shameful to be a layman if you act like an expert
We've got our archetypes
We can't escape

There will always be a best and an average
But we can all rule
Greatness has more dimensions than we perceive
All tired of trying to be admired
Algorithms make it feel worse

Melted in obscurity
One raindrop in the storm
The one that breaks the dam
Wouldn't happen without the others

Peddled influence
Subdominant
Momentum balance

Kiss the world goodbye it's time to go

Unique rhymes with domestique

Churning
Ablating

Chapeau
Plateau
Throw
Stowed
In tow
Schmo
Sowed

Ride slow
See the world outside your window

Something about no influence
Maybe compressible
Shock

Pain ripples through
