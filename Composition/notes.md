# Slundge composition notes

## Solo break

Because who wants some boring-ass normal beat?
I was brainstorming a way to make this part interesting when I stumbled upon
some Mattias IA Eklundh videos on YouTube.
He has a tune with a part that "compresses," or gets faster over time.
In that vein, I decided to make this part compress and "rarify"
in a systematic and somewhat meaningful manner.

Some of the themes in the lyrics of this tune involve continuum or fluid
mechanics, so I was looking for a way to encode something relevant from that
field; maybe an important equation and/or its solution.

It "breathes" a bit, but at different wavelengths on different drums.
Sort of like the Orbitz in Bugz, except rather than keeping the periods
constant but in specified ratios, they change with their own periods.

What are these periods you ask?

We have a cycle of 4-3-2-1-2-3... that lasts, well, the sum of those.

We have a cycle of 4-5-6-5... that also lasts the sum of those.

Then with the cymbals, we have...


## Second verse tempo change

I originally recorded the second verse sort of ignoring the click, and it just
kind of happened to feel like 4 under 5, i.e., 4 beats of verse taking up the
same time as 5 beats of the normal tempo. This works out to 139.2 BPM.

Turns out that was wrong though, and it really felt right as 3/5 the main
tempo, which sort of makes it like the verse tempo is a minor 3rd of the
main tempo. Is that lame? I don't know.
Is there something theoretically meaningful about it?
Should tempo changes be "harmonic" or "functional?"
The chords are I, I+4, I+2(sus?), iii+9.
Doesn't seem like there's a connection.

I really need to start writing songs without so many tempo changes because it
really slows things down---no pun intended.
