# Slundge composition notes

## Solo break

Because who wants some boring-ass normal beat?
I was brainstorming a way to make this part interesting when I stumbled upon
some Mattias IA Eklundh videos on YouTube.
He has a tune with a part that "compresses," or gets faster over time.
In that vein, I decided to make this part compress and "rarify"
in a systematic and somewhat meaningful manner.

Some of the themes in the lyrics of this tune involve continuum or fluid
mechanics, so I was looking for a way to encode something relevant from that
field; maybe an important equation and/or its solution.

It "breathes" a bit, but at different wavelengths on different drums.
Sort of like the Orbitz in Bugz, except rather than keeping the periods
constant but in specified ratios, they change with their own periods.

What are these periods you ask?

We have a cycle of 4-3-2-1-0-1-2-3... in the snare and ride, which sums to 16.

We have a cycle of 4-5-6-5... in the kick that lasts the sum of those (20).

20/16 is 5/4, which is the same as a major 3rd in just intonation.

Then with the cymbals, we have 9-10 repeating over an over again, which lasts
19 notes each cycle, of course.

Random walker segments show up with a smaller and smaller period between them.


## Second verse tempo change

I originally recorded the second verse sort of ignoring the click, and it just
kind of happened to feel like 4 under 5, i.e., 4 beats of verse taking up the
same time as 5 beats of the normal tempo. This works out to 139.2 BPM.

Turns out that was wrong though, and it really felt right as 3/5 the main
tempo, which sort of makes it like the verse tempo is a minor 3rd of the
main tempo. Is that lame? I don't know.
Is there something theoretically meaningful about it?
Should tempo changes be "harmonic" or "functional?"
The chords are I, I+4, I+2(sus?), iii+9.
Doesn't seem like there's a connection.

I really need to start writing songs without so many tempo changes because it
really slows things down---no pun intended.


## Nu-metal-Dream-Theater-Steve-Vai solo harmony

The riff came about by feel, and apparently in the with respect to Ab, the
notes are from the 5th mode of the melodic minor scale, also known at the
Mixolydian b6 scale.

The part after changes harmony though, starting off in Ab Mixolydian b6, then
back to Ab major for a chord, then to a \#4, which feels like a shift to
Lydian dominant, the 4th mode of the melodic minor scale. The last lick then
moves back to Ab major.

None of this is really intentional--I guess just interesting that it sounds
like it goes together when changing "note buckets" so often.


## Navier--Stokes as music

_This was not implemented. Maybe it should be in another song._

See https://www.mech.kth.se/~luca/Smak/rec4.pdf

I had the goal of representing at least continuum mechanics musically.

We have a solution to this equation, which is the music.

The derivatives of the solution are

What is the derivative of a note, a melody, a rhythm? The rate of change with
respect to some dimension.

Dimensions or quantities or variables are frequency, intensity, tempo, time,
pitch, subdivision choice or spacing

Pitch is vibrations per unit time

How to represent a quasi periodic time series like a musical section as a
single solution or function?

Tempo vs time
Pitch vs time
Rhythmic period (inverse of hits per unit time) versus time
Time between notes

Fun to listen to if it's confusing at first but can eventually be understood or
followed

What do we have so far?
Oscillating between two chords, then shifting to another to end
How long does each chord last?
What frequencies are in the chord?
A solo idea with arpeggios

Solutions can also have probability distributions, or spectrums
We could have a 5/3 slope describing prevalence of large versus small rhythmic
structures

Random walk for x-location on piano

Guitar x--y position can be a function of time, functions of each other,
derivatives, these have speeds as well

Pressure is like an external instrument. Rate of change of pressure as we move
in the x direction affects speed in that direction

We want this part of the song to satisfy a differential equation
